# /define — Product Definition Facilitation

Facilitate a product definition session to transform a fuzzy idea into a clear, validated product definition. This is about WHAT to build and WHY — not technical implementation.

## Instructions

1. Read the skill guide: `skills/product-definition/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the session flow through all 9 phases
3. Load facilitation prompts from `skills/product-definition/references/facilitation-prompts.md` for each phase
4. When facing common situations (saying "both", going too broad/deep, contradictions), consult `skills/product-definition/references/facilitation-techniques.md`
5. Generate the output artifact as described in the skill guide
