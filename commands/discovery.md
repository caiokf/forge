# /discovery — Domain Discovery Facilitation

Facilitate an open-ended Domain Discovery session to explore and understand a problem space before committing to specific modeling techniques.

## Instructions

1. Read the skill guide: `skills/domain-discovery/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the session flow through all 13 phases (areas to explore, not a strict sequence)
3. Load facilitator prompts from `skills/domain-discovery/references/facilitator-prompts.md` for each phase
4. When conversation stalls or goes sideways, consult `skills/domain-discovery/references/recovery-techniques.md`
5. At synthesis, recommend the appropriate next technique based on findings

## Technique Recommendations

| Finding                               | Recommended Next Step |

| Complex workflows with many events    | `/storm`              |
| Need to design a system end-to-end    | `/model`              |
| Multiple teams or systems interacting | `/context`            |
| Production readiness concerns         | `/residuality`        |
