2. Follow the session flow through all 9 phases
3. Load facilitator prompts from `skills/event-modeling/references/facilitator-prompts.md` for each phase
4. When participants get blocked, use techniques from `skills/event-modeling/references/unsticking-techniques.md`
5. Generate the output artifact using `skills/event-modeling/templates/event-model.md`
