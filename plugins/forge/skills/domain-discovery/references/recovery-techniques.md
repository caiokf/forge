# Domain Discovery — Recovery Techniques

Approaches for when the conversation stalls or goes sideways during a discovery session.

---

## When Conversation Stalls

- "What else should I know about this domain?"
- "What question should I have asked but didn't?"
- "What would surprise me about how this actually works?"
- "What do newcomers always get wrong?"
- "What's the most interesting problem in this domain?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you change?"

## When You've Gone Down a Wrong Path

- "Let me pause — I think I may have been asking about the wrong thing. Can you help me understand [X] better?"
- "Let me check my understanding so far — [summary]. How far off am I?"
- "This is interesting, but I'm wondering if we should park it and come back later. What do you think?"

## When Participant Says "I Don't Know"

- "That's useful — what would you need to find out?"
- "Who would know?"
- "What happens in practice when no one knows?"
- "If you had to guess, what's your intuition?"

## When Participant Is Too Verbose

- "I'm hearing several threads — [X], [Y], and [Z]. Can we focus on [X] first?"

## When Participant Is Too Terse

- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Tell me about the last time this happened."
