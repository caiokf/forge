| Technique                 | Prompt                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Pretend It's Broken"** | "Imagine this has been live 6 months and customers are complaining. What are they complaining about?"                 |
| **"New Employee"**        | "If a new team member asked 'why does this event exist?', what would you tell them?"                                  |
| **"Customer Support"**    | "A customer calls support about this feature. What questions might they ask?"                                         |
| **"Rollback"**            | "If we had to undo this action, what information would we need?"                                                      |
| **"Audit Log"**           | "In 2 years, legal asks for a complete history. What do we need recorded?"                                            |
| **"Concrete Example"**    | "Let's pick a specific user: Jane from Acme Corp, on Pro plan, 10 days into trial. What exactly happens when she...?" |
| **"Skip and Return"**     | "Let's mark this 'TBD' and move on. We'll revisit after modeling more."                                               |
