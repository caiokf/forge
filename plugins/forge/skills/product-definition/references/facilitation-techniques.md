# Product Definition — Facilitation Techniques

Techniques for handling common situations during product definition sessions.

---

## When They Say "Both"

Don't accept it. Force the choice:

- "If you absolutely had to pick one, which?"
- "What if I told you 'both' means 'neither done well'?"
- "Which would you cut if you ran out of time?"

## When They Go Too Broad

Narrow ruthlessly:

- "That's three products. Which one are we defining today?"
- "Let's focus on the first user. We can expand later."
- "What's the 80/20 — what 20% delivers 80% of value?"

## When They Go Too Deep

Pull back to product level:

- "That's implementation. Let's stay at what, not how."
- "Interesting, but does it affect the product definition?"
- "Park that for the technical phase."

## When There's a Contradiction

Name it directly:

- "You said [X] earlier but now you're saying [Y]. Which is it?"
- "These two things can't both be true. Let's resolve it."
- "I'm hearing tension between [A] and [B]. That's a decision."

## When They're Attached to a Bad Idea

Challenge gently but firmly:

- "Help me understand why that's essential."
- "What would you lose if we cut that?"
- "That adds complexity. Is the value worth it?"
- "What if we tried the opposite?"

## When You've Found Clarity

Lock it in:

- "That feels clear. Let me write that down."
- "Say that again — that's the core."
- "Yes. That's it. Let's build on that."

## Recovery Techniques

### When the Session Stalls

- "What are you most excited about?"
- "What are you most worried about?"
- "If you had to ship tomorrow, what would it be?"
- "What would your ideal user complain about if we don't get this right?"
- "Let's try the opposite of what you said. Does that feel wrong?"

### When Going in Circles

- "We've discussed this a few times. What's making it hard to decide?"
- "Is this actually two separate decisions?"
- "Let's make a provisional choice and see if it breaks anything."

### When They're Frustrated

- "This is hard because you care about it. That's good."
- "Ambiguity now saves pain later."
- "Let's take a step back. What's the one thing you're certain about?"
