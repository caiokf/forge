# Product Definition

This skill provides knowledge and facilitation guidance for product definition sessions — transforming fuzzy ideas into clear, validated product definitions by challenging assumptions, resolving contradictions, and guiding tradeoff decisions. This is about figuring out WHAT to build and WHY, not technical implementation.

## When to Use

This skill should be used when:

- Starting with an idea in your head that needs structure
- Beginning a new product, app, or feature from scratch
- Needing to validate whether an idea makes sense before investing
- Wanting assumptions challenged and contradictions found
- Making hard tradeoff decisions (features vs simplicity, scope vs UX)
- Exploring how a conceptual model serves product goals

## When NOT to Use

- Already have a clear product definition and need implementation planning → create a roadmap
- Exploring a technical domain → use `/discovery`
- Designing system architecture → use `/event-modeling` or `/event-storming`
- Need a detailed PRD with specs → do that after `/define`

## Core Principles

1. **Challenge, don't just capture** — Push back on contradictions and assumptions
2. **Tradeoffs are decisions** — Force choices, don't let "both" slide
3. **Simplicity is a feature** — Every addition has a cost
4. **Model serves product** — Conceptual choices should enable product goals
5. **Clarity over completeness** — A clear subset beats a fuzzy whole

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: The Elevator Pitch (2-3 exchanges)

Get the raw idea out — what it is, who it's for, what problem it solves, why someone would use it, the one thing it must do well.

### Phase 2: The Anti-Vision (2-3 exchanges)

Define what this is NOT — non-goals, features that would be wrong, differentiation from competitors, what would make it bloated.

### Phase 3: User & Context (3-5 exchanges)

Understand who uses this and when — ideal user's situation, trigger moments, usage frequency, environment, device, mood.

### Phase 4: Core Experience (3-5 exchanges)

Define the essential interaction — core use case walkthrough, minimum for value, the "aha moment," what makes them return.

### Phase 5: Feature Boundaries (3-5 exchanges)

Draw the line — must-have vs nice-to-have vs never. Force tradeoffs between features, complexity, and polish.

### Phase 6: Model Implications (3-5 exchanges)

Explore how conceptual structure affects product potential — the "atom," relationships, history/state, structural lock-ins, scalability.

### Phase 7: Edge Cases & Exceptions (2-3 exchanges)

Find where the model breaks — empty states, scale extremes, error recovery, concurrency, worst cases.

### Phase 8: Success Criteria (2-3 exchanges)

Define what winning looks like — metrics, user advocacy, pride points, kill criteria.

### Phase 9: Synthesis & Validation (2-3 exchanges)

Confirm the definition is coherent — playback, gap identification, remaining uncertainties.

## Session Patterns

| Starting Point           | Focus                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Brand new idea           | All phases sequentially, more back-and-forth in early phases       |
| Partially formed idea    | Skim phases 1-2, focus on phases 5-6 (tradeoffs and model)         |
| Idea with contradictions | Heavy focus on Phase 2 (Anti-Vision), challenges throughout        |
| Technical founder        | Watch for implementation jumping, keep pulling to "what" and "why" |

## Output Artifact

Generate a markdown document containing:

1. One-liner description
2. Problem statement
3. Target user (situation, not demographics)
4. Core value proposition
5. Anti-Vision — explicit non-goals
6. Core experience and "aha moment"
7. Feature set — must-have, nice-to-have, out of scope
8. Conceptual model — core entity, structure, implications
9. UX principles
10. Success criteria
11. Open questions and risks
12. Next steps
