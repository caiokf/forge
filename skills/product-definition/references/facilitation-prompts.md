# Product Definition — Facilitation Prompts

Detailed prompts organized by session phase. Use these during facilitation to guide the conversation through each phase.

---

## Phase 1: The Elevator Pitch

```
OPENING:
"Tell me about this idea. Don't worry about structure — just describe
what you're imagining. We'll shape it together."

FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "In one or two sentences, what is this?"
- "Who is this for? Be specific — not 'everyone.'"
- "What problem does it solve? What pain does it remove?"
- "Why would someone use this instead of what they do today?"
- "What's the one thing this absolutely must do well?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "You said it's for [X] but also [Y] — those are different people. Which is primary?"
- "Is this a vitamin (nice to have) or a painkiller (must have)?"
- "If someone only had 30 seconds to understand this, what would you say?"
```

## Phase 2: The Anti-Vision

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "What is this explicitly NOT?"
- "What features would be obvious to add but wrong for this product?"
- "What similar products exist, and how is this different?"
- "What would make this bloated or lose its soul?"
- "What would you refuse to add even if users asked for it?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "You said it's simple, but you also want [X, Y, Z] — which matters more?"
- "That sounds like [competitor]. What makes someone choose this instead?"
- "If you had to kill one of these features, which goes first?"
```

## Phase 3: User & Context

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "Describe your ideal user. Not demographics — their situation and mindset."
- "When do they reach for this? What triggers that moment?"
- "Where are they — physically, mentally — when they use this?"
- "How often do they use it? Daily ritual, occasional tool, one-time thing?"
- "What are they doing before and after using this?"

CONTEXT PROMPTS:
- "Are they in a hurry or do they have time?"
- "Are they alone or with others?"
- "What device, what environment?"
- "What mood are they in when they need this?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "You said [casual users] but also [power features] — those conflict. Which wins?"
- "If they only have 10 seconds, what must happen?"
- "What would make them abandon this mid-use?"
```

---

## Phase 4: Core Experience

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "Walk me through the core use case, start to finish."
- "What's the minimum they need to do to get value?"
- "What's the 'aha moment' — when do they feel it worked?"
- "What does success look like for the user?"
- "What would make them come back tomorrow?"

SIMPLICITY PROMPTS:
- "Can we remove a step from this flow?"
- "What if there were no settings — what would the defaults be?"
- "What's the one-screen version of this?"
- "If it had to work offline, what's essential?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "That's three steps — can it be one?"
- "You're describing two different use cases. Which is primary?"
- "What if you only had one button? What would it do?"
```

---

## Phase 5: Feature Boundaries

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "List the features you're imagining. Let's get them all out."
- "Now let's sort: must-have for launch vs. nice-to-have vs. never."
- "For each must-have — why? What breaks without it?"
- "For each nice-to-have — what's the cost of not having it at launch?"
- "What would version 1 have that version 0.1 doesn't?"

TRADEOFF PROMPTS:
- "You have [Feature A] and [Feature B]. If you could only ship one, which?"
- "This feature adds complexity for all users to benefit some. Worth it?"
- "Every feature has a maintenance cost. Is this worth maintaining forever?"
- "Would users rather have [X] polished or [X + Y] rough?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "You said 'simple' but this feature list isn't. What gives?"
- "That's a power-user feature. Is this a power-user product?"
- "This sounds like scope creep. What's the core again?"
```

---

## Phase 6: Model Implications

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "How do you think about the core data or concepts in this?"
- "What's the 'atom' — the smallest meaningful unit?"
- "What gets created, saved, shared, or deleted?"
- "How do things relate to each other?"
- "What happens over time — is there history, state, progression?"

IMPLICATION PROMPTS:
- "If you structure it that way, [future feature] becomes easy/hard."
- "That model optimizes for [X]. But you said [Y] matters — tension?"
- "If users want to share/export this later, does this structure help or hurt?"
- "This locks you into [pattern]. Is that intentional?"
- "What happens when there's a lot of this data? Does the model scale conceptually?"

INTEGRATION PROMPTS:
- "If you wanted to connect this to [external service] later, how would this model help or hinder?"
- "Your structure assumes [X]. What if users think about it differently?"
- "Is this model user-facing or internal? Does it match how users think?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "You want [flexibility] but this model is [rigid]. Pick one."
- "This is optimized for creation. But you said consumption matters more."
- "Simple model or powerful model? You're trying to have both."
```

## Phase 7: Edge Cases & Exceptions

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "What happens when there's nothing yet? Empty state?"
- "What happens when there's too much? Hundreds, thousands of items?"
- "What if they make a mistake? How do they recover?"
- "What if two people try to do the same thing?"
- "What's the worst case scenario? How does it fail gracefully?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "You didn't mention [edge case]. Is that in scope or not?"
- "This flow assumes [happy path]. What about [realistic problem]?"
- "What do power users do that breaks your simple model?"
```

---

## Phase 8: Success Criteria

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "How do you know if this product is successful?"
- "What would users say to recommend this to others?"
- "What's the one metric that matters most?"
- "Six months from now, what makes you proud of this?"
- "What would make you kill this product?"

CHALLENGE PROMPTS:
- "That's a vanity metric. What actually indicates value delivered?"
- "You said [goal A] and [goal B] — they might conflict. Which wins?"
- "Is success measured by you or by users?"
```

---

## Phase 9: Synthesis & Validation

```
FACILITATOR PROMPTS:
- "Let me play back what I heard. Tell me what's wrong."
- "Does this feel like the product you imagined?"
- "What am I still missing?"
- "Is there anything you're unsure about that we should flag?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how clear is this now? What would make it a 10?"

FINAL CHALLENGES:
- "If you had to describe this to an engineer in 60 seconds, what would you say?"
- "If someone built exactly this, would you be happy?"
- "What's the biggest remaining risk or uncertainty?"
```
